# SOR_Content
A public copy of all the pages, lessons, and resources in the Science of Reading mobile app https://scienceofreading.app .

While we work to make the entire code base Open Source, here's a copy of the lessons data. 

NOTE: This copy is not automatically updated yet. Contact Ed if you need it refreshed.

The SOR mobile app is built with love and the [Nativescript](https://nativescript.org) open source app framework.

## Use
* pages_list.js contains the overall info for each page. (Sometimes with sections).
* xp_list.js contains each resource (study, video link, podcast, etc.) and the descriptive info with it.
* timeline_entries.js is just for the Timeline page. (Basically, each entry has a year.)

Each page entry SHOULD contain a list of the XP's and timeline_entries on that page. Unfortunately, we didn't start it that way, and not all have been converted yet. Contact Ed if you need it.
